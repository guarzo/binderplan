Volume II shifts inward.

This volume is not about what Pokemon do, but about how they are remembered, lived with, and understood across time.

Here you'll find:

- Pokemon as companions rather than actors
- Art shaped by cultural eras rather than narrative moments
- Quiet scenes that imply belonging, routine, and continuity
- Images that resist spectacle in favor of familiarity and identity

Volume II is intentionally softer, slower, and more reflective. Its themes are narrower, but deeper — and demand stronger curation.

---

## Chapter I — Companions

*Pokemon whose identity is shaped through shared presence*

Pokemon defined by an ongoing relationship with a human or another Pokemon. The bond is mutual, enduring, and central to the image.

**Key signals:**
- Shared space or purpose
- Emotional reciprocity
- Pokemon is not complete alone

## Chapter II — Quiet Familiarity

*Where Pokemon belong, without needing to act*

Quiet scenes that evoke home, routine, or gentle belonging. Pokemon are neither active nor isolated — they are held by their environment.

**Key signals:**
- Domestic scale
- Soft attention or ease
- Familiarity rather than narrative

## Chapter III — Era Identity

*Foundational visions of Pokemon across time*

Pokemon presented as emblematic of an era's visual language and worldview. These cards are not moments, stories, or emotions — they are statements.

**Key signals:**
- Iconic or instructional composition
- Minimal narrative implication
- Art that defines "what Pokemon are" at a specific time

**Entry rule:** A card must meaningfully fail at least two other themes to qualify.

## Curation Notes

Volume II themes do not auto-expand. No theme grows beyond 2 pages without deliberate review.

A card may be loved and still excluded. "Almost fits" means it doesn't fit yet.

Volume II is not a home for leftovers. It is a second thesis.

*Volume II is not about collecting more — it is about understanding why certain images stay.*
