Volume II shifts inward.

This volume is not about what Pokémon do, but about how they are remembered, lived with, and understood across time.

Here you'll find:

- Pokémon as companions rather than actors
- Art shaped by cultural eras rather than narrative moments
- Quiet scenes that imply belonging, routine, and continuity
- Timeless beings depicted as complete, self-contained forces
- Liminal moments at borders, entrances, and passages

Volume II is intentionally softer, slower, and more reflective. Its themes are narrower, but deeper — and demand stronger curation.

## Chapter I — Companions

*Bond without spectacle*

Pokémon and humans (or other Pokémon) in relationships defined by trust, care, or shared stillness. The bond is mutual, enduring, and central to the image.

**Key signals:**
- Shared space or purpose
- Emotional reciprocity
- Pokémon is not complete alone

## Chapter II — Quiet Familiarity

*Domestic calm and lived-in worlds*

Pokémon adjacent to everyday life, invoking comfort, routine, or family without narrative emphasis. They are neither active nor isolated — they are held by their environment.

**Key signals:**
- Domestic scale
- Soft attention or ease
- Familiarity rather than narrative

## Chapter III — Era Identity

*Inherited visual language*

Pokémon as they were once framed — simple, centered, iconic, and culturally formative. These cards are not moments, stories, or emotions — they are statements about what Pokémon meant at a specific time.

**Key signals:**
- Iconic or instructional composition
- Minimal narrative implication
- Art that defines "what Pokémon are" at a specific time

**Hard cap recommended:** This section should be smaller than others to preserve its integrity. A card must meaningfully fail at least two other themes to qualify.

## Chapter IV — Enduring Presence

*Power that no longer needs to move*

Pokémon depicted as complete, self-contained forces — not in action, not in transition, but already fully realized. Timeless beings whose power is contained, not expressed.

**Key signals:**
- The Pokémon feels finished, not becoming
- Power is contained, not expressed
- The pose suggests continuity, not motion
- The viewer feels they arrived too late to see the beginning

**What this is not:**
- Not "legendary Pokémon only"
- Not explosions, beams, or attacks
- Not Awakening or transformation

**Examples that fit:** Mew depicted calmly; Celebi framed as existing outside time; early Umbreon watchful and quiet; Dragonite as presence rather than flight.

If Awakening Power is about energy gathering, Enduring Presence is about energy that no longer needs to gather. This theme gives Volume II gravity without noise.

## Chapter V — Threshold

*The space between moments*

Pokémon positioned at borders, entrances, or moments of passage — emotionally, spatially, or symbolically. Movement without action. Progression without chaos.

**Key signals:**
- Doorways, paths, bridges, city edges
- Pokémon facing into or out of a space
- A sense of "just before" or "just after"
- Liminal light (dusk, dawn, fog, interior glow)

**Cards that often belong here:**
- Pokémon in streets, alleys, hallways
- Figures half-turned away from the viewer
- Scenes where the Pokémon is between roles (not resting, not attacking)

Threshold is emotional architecture. It lets the binder breathe. This is where Volume II exhales.

## Curation Notes

Volume II themes do not auto-expand. No theme grows beyond 2 pages without deliberate review.

A card may be loved and still excluded. "Almost fits" means it doesn't fit yet.

**Preventing drift:** The five-chapter structure solves the problem of Era Identity becoming a catch-all for old cards:
- Cards that are old but emotionally active belong in Companions or Quiet Familiarity
- Cards that are timeless move to Enduring Presence
- Cards that imply movement without action move to Threshold
- Era Identity remains small and strict — reserved only for cards that define an era's visual language

Nothing is homeless — but nothing is allowed to drift.

Volume II is not a home for leftovers. It is a second thesis.

*Volume II is not about collecting more — it is about understanding why certain images stay.*
