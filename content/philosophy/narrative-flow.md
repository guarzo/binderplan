The binder is read like a book. Page order matters.

## The Emotional Arc

```
Belonging → Motion → Power → Threat → Reflection
```

---

## Chapter Structure

### Chapter I — Belonging & Safety

- Calm in Nature
- World of People
- At Rest

*The opening establishes peace, connection, and groundedness.*

---

### Chapter II — Motion & Life

- Joyful Action
- Journey *(if/when it emerges)*

*Energy builds. Pokemon are active, engaged, moving through the world.*

---

### Chapter III — Power Awakening (Binder Hinge)

- Awakened Power
- Legendary Bearing

*The midpoint pivot. Power emerges but remains contained.*

---

### Chapter IV — Threat & Conflict

- Intimidation
- On the Attack

*Tension peaks. Pokemon are dangerous, committed, overwhelming.*

---

### Chapter V — Isolation & Reflection

- Elemental Solitude
- Contemplation

*The binder resolves in stillness and introspection.*

---

## Volume I Focus

**Volume I** focuses on *lived experience*:

- How Pokemon exist in the world
- How they move, rest, threaten, think, and belong

Large-scale mythic or overwhelming power is intentionally constrained so it does not dominate the narrative.

---

## Volume II (Reserved)

**Volume II: Power & Myth** *(recommended future direction)*

Purpose:
- Absorb large-scale, iconic, cosmic, or ceremonial power
- Prevent Legendary and Awakened themes from overwhelming Volume I

Volume II should feel *distinct*, not like "more of the same."
