title: "Grading Philosophy"
description: "When and why to slab a card"
---

Slabs are **finished statements**, not flexible pieces.

> **Binders = gallery walls**
> **Slabs = framed originals**

A card is graded when it is considered *final*.

---

## Slab Roles

Every graded card must have one clear role:

### CROWN_ART
Best art version of a card; grade supports presentation.

### DEFINITIVE_[POKEMON]
The canonical version of a Pokemon in the collection.

### HISTORICAL
Vintage, first appearances, culturally significant cards.

### LIQUID
Investment or trade-focused slabs; no emotional attachment.

## Physical Organization

### Tier A — Display
- Crown art & historical icons
- Few at a time
- Rotated intentionally

### Tier B — Archive Cases
- Pokemon-definitive slabs
- Sorted by Pokemon → Era → Grade

### Tier C — Slab Boxes
- Liquid / duplicate slabs
- Stored upright, labeled, replaceable

## What Gets Graded

**Grade if:**
- It completes a Pokemon story
- It is the best version you plan to own
- It is vintage and condition-sensitive
- You would be annoyed owning it raw

**Do not grade if:**
- You enjoy rearranging it
- The card relies on binder flow
- It is easily replaceable modern filler

---

## Authority Rules

- Graded copy becomes canonical
- Art-first cards favor binders
- Pokemon completion may favor slabs
- No duplication unless purpose-driven

---

## End-State Vision

- **Binders:** Evolving, expressive, personal
- **Slabs:** Stable, intentional, declarative
- **Storage:** Minimal emotional clutter

> **Grading is not about plastic — it is about declaring a card *finished*.**
