These themes are **canonical**. Every card either fits clearly into one of these themes or stays out of the binder.

---

## Volume I — Lived Experience

Volume I focuses on how Pokémon move, rest, threaten, think, and belong in the world.

---

<div class="theme-card">

### Elemental Solitude

Pokemon alone with their elemental power, defined by environment rather than action.

<p class="signal">Key signal: isolation + scale</p>
</div>

<div class="theme-card">

### Calm in Nature

Pokemon at ease within a natural setting, present but untroubled.

<p class="signal">Key signal: harmony, not sleep</p>
</div>

<div class="theme-card">

Pokemon actively moving or playing, where motion expresses happiness.

<p class="signal">Key signal: motion driven by joy</p>
</div>

<div class="theme-card">

### On the Attack

Pokemon caught mid-strike or charge, where the action itself is the subject.

<p class="signal">Key signal: commitment to action</p>
</div>

<div class="theme-card">

### Intimidation

Pokemon exerting dominance or threat through presence, posture, or atmosphere.

<p class="signal">Key signal: fear before action</p>
</div>

<div class="theme-card">

Pokemon shown meaningfully interacting with humans or human spaces.

<p class="signal">Key signal: social context matters</p>
</div>

<div class="theme-card">

<p class="signal">Key signal: vulnerability or withdrawal</p>
</div>

<div class="theme-card">

Pokemon awake and still, engaged in awareness or thought rather than action.

<p class="signal">Key signal: attention without movement</p>
</div>

<div class="theme-card">

<p class="signal">Key signal: timeless presence</p>
</div>

<div class="theme-card">

<p class="signal">Key signal: transition, tension, energy gathering</p>
</div>

## Volume II — Memory, Presence, and Passage

Volume II shifts inward — not about what Pokémon do, but about how they are remembered, lived with, and understood across time.

<div class="theme-card">

### Companions

Pokémon and humans (or other Pokémon) in relationships defined by trust, care, or shared stillness. The bond is mutual, enduring, and central to the image.

<p class="signal">Key signal: bond without spectacle</p>
</div>

<div class="theme-card">

### Quiet Familiarity

Pokémon adjacent to everyday life, invoking comfort, routine, or family without narrative emphasis. They are held by their environment.

<p class="signal">Key signal: domestic calm</p>
</div>

<div class="theme-card">

### Era Identity

Pokémon as they were once framed — simple, centered, iconic, and culturally formative. These cards define "what Pokémon meant" at a specific time.

<p class="signal">Key signal: inherited visual language</p>
</div>

<div class="theme-card">

### Enduring Presence

Pokémon depicted as complete, self-contained forces — not in action, not in transition, but already fully realized. Timeless beings whose power is contained, not expressed.

<p class="signal">Key signal: power that no longer needs to move</p>
</div>

<div class="theme-card">

### Threshold

Pokémon positioned at borders, entrances, or moments of passage — emotionally, spatially, or symbolically. Movement without action. Progression without chaos.

<p class="signal">Key signal: the space between moments</p>
</div>

---

## Graded Card Categories

Graded cards are **anchors**, not clutter. They represent permanence, personal milestones, and cards too fragile or meaningful for binder handling.

<div class="theme-card">

### Crown Art

Pinnacle works — the highest artistic achievements in the collection.

<p class="signal">Key signal: undeniable artistic mastery</p>
</div>

<div class="theme-card">

### Definitive Pokémon

The single best card for a species. The card that most fully captures what that Pokémon is.

<p class="signal">Key signal: the definitive representation</p>
</div>

<div class="theme-card">

### Historical

Era-defining cards that shaped the hobby. Cards whose significance is primarily contextual and temporal.

<p class="signal">Key signal: historical weight</p>
</div>

<div class="theme-card">

### Personal Significance

Cards with irreplaceable personal meaning. Milestones, gifts, or connections that transcend art.

<p class="signal">Key signal: personal story</p>
</div>

## Theme Admission Rule

A new theme only becomes *official* when:

1. It holds **6–9 cards**, AND
2. The cards clearly communicate the same emotional or narrative idea

Until then, cards remain in a holding stack.
