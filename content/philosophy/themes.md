These themes are **canonical**. Every card either fits clearly into one of these themes or stays out of the binder.

## Conceptual Coverage

Together, these ten themes cover the full emotional and narrative loop:

- **Environment** — Elemental Solitude, Calm in Nature
- **Motion** — Joyful Action, On the Attack
- **Power** — Intimidation, Awakened Power, Legendary Bearing
- **Stillness** — At Rest, Contemplation
- **Society** — World of People

You don't need more themes — but you *can* add more when the cards demand it.

## Theme Admission Rule

A new theme only becomes *official* when:

1. It holds **6–9 cards**, AND
2. The cards clearly communicate the same emotional or narrative idea

Until then, cards remain in a holding stack.
