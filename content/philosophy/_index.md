description: "The framework for art-first Pokemon card curation"
---

This section explains the curatorial philosophy behind the collection. Cards are organized by *mood, narrative, and visual intent* rather than set, rarity, or Pokemon type.

## Sections

- **[Core Themes](themes/)** — The 10 locked themes that form the backbone
- **[Narrative Flow](narrative-flow/)** — How the binder reads like a book
- **[Grading Philosophy](grading/)** — When and why to slab a card

## The Guiding Principle

> **A card belongs where its artwork emotionally belongs, not where its mechanics or category suggest.**

If two cards feel correct together when viewed side-by-side, they belong together.

### Theme First, Pokemon Second

- Pokemon species **do not** determine placement
- Set, era, and rarity **do not** determine placement
- A single Pokemon may appear in **multiple themes** across different cards

Each card is judged *individually*.
