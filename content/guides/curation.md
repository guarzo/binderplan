Performed **2–4 times per year**, 60–90 minutes max.

## The Process

### 1. Flip Through (No Changes)

Just look. Notice what still resonates and what feels off.

### 2. Review EDGE Pile

Look for emerging themes. Do cards cluster around a feeling you can't yet name?

### 3. Review REDUNDANT Pile

Check for upgrades. Has a better card appeared that should replace something in the binder?

### 4. Remove What No Longer Earns Its Spot

Be honest. If a card evokes no emotional response, it should leave.

### 5. Stop

Do not keep tweaking. Stability is a sign the system is working.

## Signs the Binder Is Working

- Pages feel balanced when viewed as spreads
- You want to flip through it, not "fix" it
- New cards are harder to place (the bar is rising)
- The collection feels like yours, not like an inventory

---

## Signs Something Needs Attention

- A theme feels bloated or unfocused
- Cards are staying in the EDGE pile for months
- You're forcing placements to avoid empty slots
- The binder feels like a chore to open

---

## Final Rule

> **If a card stays in EDGE for over 12 months, it is not a core card.**

That is clarity — not loss.
