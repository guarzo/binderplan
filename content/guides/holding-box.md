title: "Holding Box System"
description: "Where cards live outside the binder"
---

This system exists to **protect the Art Binder from overload** while preserving cards you genuinely enjoy.

The holding box is not a failure state — it is an **incubation space**.

---

## Core Rule

> **A card enters the binder by clarity, not by effort.**

If placement requires debate, justification, or compromise, the card belongs in a holding box.

---

## Box Structure

Use **separate labeled sections** (physical dividers or envelopes). Do not mix categories.

---

### 1. EDGE (Theme Candidates)

**Label:** `EDGE – Possible Theme`

Cards that:
- Almost fit an existing theme
- Repeat a feeling you can't yet name
- Feel important but homeless

**Rules:**
- Review every 1–2 months
- A new theme only forms if 8–12 cards naturally accumulate

---

### 2. REDUNDANT (Good but Surplus)

**Label:** `REDUNDANT – Theme Overflow`

Cards that:
- Fit an existing theme
- But do not improve a page
- Are visually weaker than current binder cards

**Rules:**
- These cards protect you from regret
- May replace binder cards later if taste changes

---

### 3. HERITAGE (Respect Without Display)

**Label:** `HERITAGE – Keep, Don't Display`

Cards that:
- Are nostalgic or historic
- Feel meaningful but visually quiet
- Are better respected than showcased

**Rules:**
- Never force into art themes
- Can later anchor vintage-specific themes

---

### 4. FUTURE SELF

**Label:** `FUTURE SELF – Revisit Later`

Cards that:
- You like but don't fully understand yet
- May resonate differently in the future

**Rules:**
- Review annually
- If nothing changes after a year, downgrade to storage or release

---

### 5. RELEASE

**Label:** `RELEASE – Trade / Sell / Gift`

Cards that:
- Evoke no strong feeling
- Do not fit any theme
- Are kept only out of habit or value

**Rules:**
- Do not revisit emotionally
- Convert into funding, trades, or goodwill

---

## Review Cadence

| Box | Frequency |
|-----|-----------|
| EDGE | Monthly or bi-monthly |
| REDUNDANT | As needed |
| HERITAGE | Rarely |
| FUTURE SELF | Once per year |
| RELEASE | Quarterly |

---

## Final Rule

> **Liking a card is not enough for binder inclusion.**

Your binder is for:
- Cards that say something
- Cards that belong together
- Cards that change the feel of a page

Everything else can still be liked, owned, and respected — just not displayed.
