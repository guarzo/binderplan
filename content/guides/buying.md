description: "Questions to ask before any purchase"
---

This checklist exists to **protect your taste** and prevent impulse drift.

Before buying any card, walk through this list in order.

---

## Step 1: Emotional Signal

> *What is this card actually showing me?*

Choose **one**:

- Calm
- Rest
- Thought
- Joyful motion
- Aggression
- Threat
- Power awakening
- Timeless presence
- Human coexistence
- Elemental isolation

**If no clear signal appears → do not buy.**

---

## Step 2: Theme Fit

> *Which existing theme would this card strengthen?*

Rules:
- Strengthen means **improve**, not just match
- If it only duplicates a feeling, skip it

**If it doesn't strengthen a theme → EDGE box at most.**

---

## Step 3: Visual Necessity

> *Would removing one current binder card make room for this?*

**If the answer is no → skip.**

This keeps binder quality rising.

---

## Step 4: Uniqueness Check

> *Is this moment already represented in my collection?*

- Same Pokemon ≠ same moment
- Same rarity ≠ same impact

**If it adds no new visual idea → skip.**

---

## Step 5: Time Test

> *If I saw this card again in six months, would I still want it?*

**If unsure → wait.**

---

## Step 6: Grading Question (Optional)

> *Is this card a moment — or a monument?*

- Moment → Binder
- Monument → Consider grading

Do not grade impulsively.

---

## Automatic Yes (Rare)

A card may bypass steps if:
- It perfectly fills a known gap
- It completes a visual sequence
- It emotionally replaces an existing card

These should be uncommon.

---

## Final Rule

> **If you need to justify the purchase, it's not right.**

Great cards explain themselves instantly.
