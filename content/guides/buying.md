title: "Buying Checklist"
description: "Questions to ask before any purchase"
---

This checklist exists to **protect your taste** and prevent impulse drift.

Before buying any card, walk through this list in order.

---

## Step 1: Emotional Signal

> *What is this card actually showing me?*

Choose **one**:

**Volume I — Lived Experience:**
- Calm in nature
- At rest
- World of people (human coexistence)
- Joyful action
- Awakened power
- Legendary bearing
- Intimidation
- On the attack
- Elemental solitude
- Contemplation

**Volume II — Memory & Presence:**
- Companionship (bond without spectacle)
- Quiet familiarity (domestic calm)
- Era identity (inherited visual language)
- Enduring presence (power that no longer needs to move)
- Threshold (the space between moments)

**If no clear signal appears → do not buy.**

---

## Step 2: Theme Fit

> *Which existing theme would this card strengthen?*

**Volume I chapters:**
- Belonging & Safety
- Motion & Life
- Power Awakening
- Threat & Conflict
- Isolation & Reflection

**Volume II chapters:**
- Companions
- Quiet Familiarity
- Era Identity
- Enduring Presence
- Threshold

Rules:
- Strengthen means **improve**, not just match
- If it only duplicates a feeling, skip it
- Volume II themes are narrower — "almost fits" means it doesn't fit

**If it doesn't strengthen a theme → EDGE box at most.**

---

## Step 3: Visual Necessity

> *Would removing one current binder card make room for this?*

**If the answer is no → skip.**

This keeps binder quality rising.

---

## Step 4: Uniqueness Check

> *Is this moment already represented in my collection?*

- Same Pokemon ≠ same moment
- Same rarity ≠ same impact

**If it adds no new visual idea → skip.**

---

## Step 5: Time Test

> *If I saw this card again in six months, would I still want it?*

**If unsure → wait.**

---

## Step 6: Grading Question (Optional)

> *Is this card a moment — or a monument?*

- Moment → Binder
- Monument → Consider grading

**Graded card categories:**
- **Crown Art** — Pinnacle works; the highest artistic achievements
- **Definitive Pokemon** — The single best card for a species
- **Historical** — Era-defining cards that shaped the hobby
- **Personal Significance** — Cards with irreplaceable personal meaning

A card must clearly belong to one of these categories to justify grading. Do not grade impulsively.

---

## Automatic Yes (Rare)

A card may bypass steps if:
- It perfectly fills a known gap
- It completes a visual sequence
- It emotionally replaces an existing card

These should be uncommon.

---

## Final Rule

> **If you need to justify the purchase, it's not right.**

Great cards explain themselves instantly.
