title: "Theme Expansion"
description: "When and how to add new themes or pages"
---

Not all themes should expand equally. Expansion should feel **earned**, not indulgent.

---

## Page Allocation Rules

### Default: 1–2 Pages per Theme

This is your baseline. Most themes should live comfortably here.

### Minimum: 1 Page

If a theme can't fill one strong page, it's not ready. Do not pad.

### Expansion: 3–4 Pages (Rare, Earned)

Only when a theme proves it has internal variety. Never jump from 2 → 4 pages at once.

### Hard Cap: 5 Pages

If a theme exceeds this, **it must split**. Large themes become vague unless subdivided.

> A theme that grows too large is telling you it actually contains multiple ideas.

---

## When a Theme May Grow

A theme may grow beyond 2 pages only if:

✅ New cards introduce a new visual or emotional sub-note

❌ Not just "more of the same Pokemon"

❌ Not just higher rarity

### Good Reasons to Expand

- Different lighting (day vs night)
- Different emotional register (quiet vs heavy)
- Different scale (small Pokemon vs legendary)
- Different compositional style (vintage vs modern)

### Bad Reasons to Expand

- "I have a lot of cards I like"
- "This Pokemon appears a lot"
- "This is a valuable theme"

---

## How Expansion Should Look

### Step 1: Pause at 2 Pages

Let it live there for weeks or months.

### Step 2: Add One Additional Page

Ask: Does this page say something new?

### Step 3: Name the Difference (Internally)

Example:
- Calm in Nature — Open Light
- Calm in Nature — Under Canopy

You don't need divider labels yet — just mental clarity.

## Themes That Deserve Growth

### Highest Priority (2–3 pages over time)

**Awakened Power**
- Extremely rich concept
- Modern + vintage compatible
- Naturally absorbs "hard to place" cards
- *Most future-proof theme*

**Legendary Bearing**
- Central pillar of the binder
- Iconic, timeless cards
- Works beautifully with slabs as companions
- *If any theme becomes a "monument hall," it's this*

### Moderate Growth (2 pages max)

**Calm in Nature**
- Very expressive, but easy to dilute
- Allow growth only if sub-moods are clear

**Elemental Solitude**
- Strong, heavy theme
- Works best when sparse
- *Gains power from restraint*

### Should Stay Compact (1 page preferred)

These themes lose clarity when bloated:

- Joyful Action
- On the Attack
- Intimidation
- World of People
- At Rest
- Contemplation

*These are precision themes. If they grow, they should split, not expand.*

---

## Maximum Binder Size

**Ideal working size:** 30–36 pages (~250–300 cards)

**Hard maximum:** ~40–45 pages (~350–400 cards)

Once the binder is full:
- Stop adding pages
- Improve by replacement
- Begin conceptualizing Volume II

---

## Optional Expansion Themes (Future)

Only introduce when **6–9 cards naturally accumulate**.
