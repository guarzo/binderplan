# Welcome

This collection is curated as an **art gallery**, not an archive.

Cards are selected for aesthetic, emotional, and narrative impact. The binder represents my current taste, not everything I own. Restraint, replacement, and pacing are intentional design choices.

> **The binder is the present tense of your taste.**
> **The holding box is the past and the future.**

## Core Belief

**Art first. Favorites second. Value is a bonus, not the goal.**

Every card should either:
- Strengthen the visual cohesion of the collection, or
- Deepen attachment to a specific Pokemon
